# SQL_DataCleaning_Housing

In this SQL project, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing on a dataset of housing prices. The dataset contained a variety of inconsistencies and errors that needed to be addressed before the data could be analyzed.

- I started by importing the data into a PostgreSQL database and then performed a series of data cleaning steps. These steps included removing duplicate records, handling missing values, correcting data type errors, and standardizing values across different columns.

- Once the data was cleaned, I designed and executed SQL queries to gain insights into the data. I analyzed housing prices by city, zip code, and property type, and calculated key metrics such as average price per square foot and median sale price. I also explored correlations between housing prices and other factors such as crime rates and school district quality.

- To visualize the data, I used Tableau to create interactive dashboards and charts. These visualizations provide a clear picture of the trends and patterns in the data, helping to inform decision-making and policy development related to housing.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in database management, data cleaning, SQL querying, and data visualization, and shows how these skills can be applied to real-world problems in the housing market.
